// create an environment object with 8 variables.
// create two creatures with 8 corresponding attributes
// set the corresponding attributes to random numbers

// each generation goes through the following cycle:
// 1) survival phase: test creature's genetic abilities against environmental pressure
//		edit creatures array to leave only those who survived
// 2) mating: random pairings. no asexual reproduction.
//		in the case of odd number of survivors, kill off the weakest
//			'weakest' could be defined several ways
//				could either be the lowest total sum of abilities
//				or lowest mean average of abilities
//				or could compare the greatest pressure to its corresponding ability in all creatures
//					and eliminate the one with the lowest score
//		children inherit parent abilities
//		do this 'sexually' i.e. children inherit four random abilities from mum, four remaining abilities from dad
//		genetic variation emulated by then adding -1, 0 or +1 to each ability.
//			this will probably become a more important factor when environmental change kicks in

// once this is done, create a world in which the environment changes over time
// watch outliers come back from the brink to dominate the world!

// later animate the whole thing, maybe make backround colours correspond to environment, using normalization or linear interpolation
//	creature colours correspond with their own abilities
// similar colours will probably be shown to corelate with passed tests 
// survival period could be done with colliding balls: creatures collide with environment, which triggers test

// give results at end: give the mean average of all creatures abilities to come up with an 'average creature'
// or check for groupings of abilities, which could be considered speciation
// then describe the environment they came about in
// only describe environmental factors with scores of 6 and above
// 6 to 7: e.g. "These creatures evolved to flourish in a sunny, oxygen rich environment"
// 8 to 9: e.g. "... and they withstood heavy meteor showers" <- more extreme description than 6 to 7
// some stories could explain why a creature survived even though it said 'sunny' but melanin was low, eg
// 		this creature never evolved physical adaptations to the UV rich environment, but learned to use its electrical resistance to create a forcefield // or say it behaved differently, e.g. hid in the ground
// as population grows, 'zoom out', have populations move into different environments
// the creatures that have to move out should be the ones with lower mean averages than the ones who stay put
